--> When we changed the network buffer size from 10 to 20 the client receiving thread running time decreased from
	42 milliseconds to 4 milliseconds. This is a significant difference and it is because when the size is increased 
	the buffer is less full often, therefore maximising the time allocated to each thread by the CPU core. For instance, 
	If the size of the buffer would be 1, the running time would be enormous. Because there is only one space that 
	can be allocated at a time. In other words, larger the buffer size --> more efficient execution time.
